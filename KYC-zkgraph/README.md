##KYC Zkgraph
I've previously built [KYC3wallet](https://devfolio.co/projects/kycwallet-d58a), which utilizes [reclaim protocol]([https://www.reclaimprotocol.org/)for user KYC verification. After the KYC process, a Soul Bound token is minted for the user. 

I deployed the contract earlier on the Polygon Mumbai testnet since HyperOracle currently doesn't support Mumbai. Now, I've also deployed the same contract on Sepolia [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xc4ca66e93dbce46e60a7e2bc85a2e8060a8e95f63bd86f79606542ed803d4054)

This zkgraph checks whether a given address is KYCverified or not.

# zkGraph default template


## Usage CLI

> Note: Only `full` image will be processed by zkOracle node. `local` (generated by commands ending with `--local` option) means the zkGraph is compiled locally and only contains partial computation (so that proving and executing will be faster).

The workflow of local zkGraph development must follow: `Develop` (code in /src) -> `Compile` (get compiled wasm image) -> `Execute` (get expected output) -> `Prove` (generate input and pre-test for actual proving in zkOracle) -> `Verify` (verify proof on-chain).

To upload and publish your zkGraph, you should `Upload` (upload code to IPFS), and then `Publish` (register zkGraph on onchain zkGraph Registry).


## Commonly used commands

- **compile**: `npx zkgraph compile`
- **exec**: `npx zkgraph exec <block id>`
- **prove**: ` npx zkgraph prove <block id> <expected state> -i|-t|-p`
